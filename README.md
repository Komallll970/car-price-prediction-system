<b><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2></b>
The Car Price Prediction System is a machine learning project designed to predict the price of used cars based on various attributes such as the car's brand, model year, fuel type, and more. The system is built with a simple user interface using Tkinter, and the backend for price prediction is powered by a Random Forest Regressor model. This model is trained using a dataset containing car details such as mileage, power, engine capacity, and more.
<h3><b>Technologies used in this project are:</b></h3> </br>
<b>Python:</b> Programming language used for the development of the system.</br>
<b>Jupyter Notebook:</b>  Used for data analysis, model training, and experimentation.</br>
<b>Tkinter: </b> Python library for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).</br>
<b>Pandas:</b>  For data manipulation and preprocessing.</br>
<b>Matplotlib:</b>  For data visualizations.</br>
<b>Scikit-learn: </b> For building and training the Random Forest Regressor model.</br>
<h3><b>Features of this project are:</b></h3> </br>
<b>User Interface: </b> Built using Tkinter for easy and interactive user input.</br>
<b>Prediction:</b>  Predicts car price based on features such as brand name, year, fuel type, etc.</br>
<b>Data Visualization:</b>  Visualizations that show the relationship between various car attributes and the car price.</br>
<b>Model Accuracy:</b>  The model uses a Random Forest Regressor to predict the car price with good accuracy.</br>
The Car Price Prediction System is a powerful tool that provides a reliable prediction of used car prices based on various attributes. By using machine learning (Random Forest Regressor), the system ensures high accuracy, and the easy-to-use Tkinter interface allows users to make predictions effortlessly. The integration of visualizations also helps to better understand the data and the modelâ€™s behavior.
